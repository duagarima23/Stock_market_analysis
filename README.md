Market Analysis and Prediction: A Deep Learning Model

We have used the LSTM model, which is useful in learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This model has four core components which include memory cell, forget gate, output gate, and input gate. Memory cell helps in holding data for longer periods. This system will provide accurate outcomes in comparison to currently available stock price predictor algorithms. The network is trained and evaluated with various sizes of input data to urge the graphical outcomes.
