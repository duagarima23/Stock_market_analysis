Market Analysis and Prediction: A Deep Learning Model

Introduction:
The prediction of stock value is a complex task that needs a robust algorithm background to compute the longer-term share prices. Stock prices are correlated within the nature of the market; hence it will be difficult to predict the costs. The proposed algorithm uses the market data to predict the share price using machine learning techniques like a recurrent neural network named Long Short Term Memory, in that process weights are corrected for each data point using stochastic gradient descent. 


Problem Statement:
Earlier we have seen many applications that use linear models for predicting and forecasting of market. However, stock market prices are highly unpredictable and volatile. This means that there are no consistent patterns in the data that allow you to model stock prices over time near-perfectly. Many neural network models are not able to handle data of time series having long-term dependencies, due to which, models are not able to hold the historical data, which furthermore affects the accuracy of the prediction.


Solution:
Here, we have used the LSTM model, which is useful in learning order dependence in sequence prediction problems. This model has four core components which include memory cell, forget gate, output gate, and input gate. Memory cell helps in holding data for longer periods. This system will provide accurate outcomes in comparison to currently available stock price predictor algorithms. The network is trained and evaluated with various sizes of input data to urge the graphical outcomes.
